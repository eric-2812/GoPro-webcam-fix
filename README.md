# GoPro Webcam Fix for Windows (HERO 8‚Äì13)

This project provides a simple fix for the issue where Windows detects your GoPro only as **MTP (storage device)** instead of a **UVC (USB Video Class) webcam**, which prevents the official **GoPro Webcam Utility** from working.

The included PowerShell script automatically installs the generic Windows UVC driver (`usbvideo.inf`) and restarts the GoPro Webcam Utility, so your GoPro HERO 8‚Äì13 can be used as a webcam in Zoom, Teams, OBS, Discord, and more.
